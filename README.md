# Guess Number Game

This is a simple command-line game where the player tries to guess a random number between 1 and 100. If the player's guess is too big, the program prints "Too big!", if it's too small, the program prints "Too small!", and if the player guesses the number, the program prints "You win!" and the game ends.

## Usage

To use this game, simply download the `guess_number_game.py` file and run it with Python 3.

The program will prompt you to enter a number between 1 and 100. After you enter your number, the program will tell you if your guess was too big, too small, or if you won the game.
